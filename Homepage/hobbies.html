        <ul class="list">
            <li><h2>Playing games</h2></li>
            <p>I love computers and video games since I was a kid. My first console was a Nintendo DSi, I used to play Pokemon in it, I had spent hours playing Pokemon, which is one of my favorite games. I have played many games throughout my life, but, unfortunately, in my country, the taxes and fees are high, because of that consoles, games, and computers are expensive here, but I still love them, even do not have money enough to buy them. Nowadays, I used to play League of Legends.

            <li><h2>Programming</h2></li>
            <p>
                I have found out about this new hobby during the lockdown, the first Programming language that I have seen was JavaScript. Since then I watch many videos about it and make simple programs. I started to attend CS50x lectures in January, I have learned new things about Compute Science, this course has changed my life and made me meet new people from other countries through cs50's Discord Server. Sometimes It was hard to solve the psets, but now I am sure that everything was worth it.

            <li><h2>Watching Animes</h2></li>
            <p>
                I love Animes (Japanese cartoons), I have been watched more than 100 animes (Maybe I'm addicted to it). My favorites genres are drama and romance, but I also like action and comedy. My favorites animes are Kimi no Wa (Your Name) and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso (Your Lie in April).
