            As I said previously, my name is Gustavo. I am a 17-year-old Brazilian who loves computers and science. I have been studying English since September of the last year. I have started cs50x in November but I have only started to watch the lectures in January, since then, I have learned plenty about computer science and I also have met nice people from other countries. Some problem sets, like this, took me many days to solve. My dream is to study at a university outside Brazil, this is why I've been studying English, learning a new language is not easy but, I am here, I cannot believe that I got so far, despite I am still learning I am so grateful for all the opportunities that I got because of the English. I still have to study more, practice my writing, my listening, and my speaking but I must tell you that it is hard to chase a great dream but it is not impossible. I am afraid of do not accomplish my dream, if I do not, there are any problems, but I will try until I cannot do more. Thank you for reading all that I have written on this homepage.
